    "content": "The key difference is in how they handle updates:\n\n**useState** triggers a re-render immediately when you call the setter function. It's synchronous in terms of scheduling the update.\n\n**useReducer** is better for complex state logic because:\n- It centralizes state update logic in one place\n- Makes testing easier (pure reducer functions)\n- Better for state that depends on previous state\n- Helpful when state updates involve multiple sub-values\n\nExample with useReducer:\n```javascript\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'increment':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    case 'decrement':\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUse **useState** for simple state, **useReducer** for complex state with multiple related values or when next state depends on previous state.",

The reducer function is a pure function, making it easier to write unit tests.\n\nAnother advantage is when you need to pass down update logic to deeply nested components - you can pass the dispatch function instead of multiple callback functions.",

Use Testing Library Queries Properly**\n- Prefer `getByRole` over `getByTestId`\n- Use `queryBy` for elements that shouldn't exist\n- Use `findBy` for async elements\n\n**3. Avoid Testing Implementation Details**\nDon't test state, props, or internal component methods directly.\n\n**4. Mock External Dependencies**\n```javascript\njest.mock('@/services/api');\n```\n\n**5. Test Accessibility**\nEnsure components are accessible:\n```javascript\nexpect(screen.getByLabelText('Email')).toBeInTheDocument();\n```\n\n**6. Use MSW for API Mocking**\nMock Service Worker provides realistic API mocking.\n\n**7. Keep Tests Simple and Readable**\nOne assertion per test when possible.\n\n**8.
